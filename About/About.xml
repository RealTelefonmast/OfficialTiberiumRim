		[DEVELOPMENT BUILD]

	-----Transmission Begin-----
Welcome back Commander.
Tiberium has spread across space. 
Humanity thought they could flee from earth 
as it was becoming crystalized.
But now it is back, closer than ever.
Now get on this Rimworld and get it under control.
Your people are counting on you.
	-----Transmisson End-----
