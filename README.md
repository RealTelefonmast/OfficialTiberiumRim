TiberiumRim - A Command &amp; Conquer based mod for the game RimWorld.

Hello and welcome to Tiberium Rim – A Command & Conquer mod for RimWorld. 

This mod is not an overhaul. It has a lot of new content but doesn't cause any incompatabilities. It only may be that a different mod may have features that conflict with this.

This mod is based on the Command & Conquer universe. The goal is to add the whole C&C universe to our beloved RimWorld, starting with the crystals and going all the way into the deepest lore and the various factions.
This will not be based on any specific game – so don't expect that.
This mod is under constant development to add all of those lovely nice features that the C&C lore has to offer.
