		<description>We've learned thanks to our random hails to nearby ships and stations that we were correct in believing the meteor is a mineral of some kind. We also learned that it is commonly called Tiberium. It is known to be toxic for life and very radioactive. Despite the risks, there is an opportunity here to learn more about it for ourselves. Inspired by some of the information given and downloaded to the console, perhaps a crane of some kind would be a safe way to study samples on site.</description>

		<description>After the discovery of toxicity from Tiberium crystals, there is a need for proper protection for our colony to wear.

		<description>As a first step towards making a protective suit, which we will call a jumpsuit from now on: there needs to be a full body piece similar to a diving suit to help ease discomfort from the next step. That step being that we need to create a material such as inlaid plates that can block radiation and toxicity. Dense materials such as lead have been long used for blocking radiation in particular, but wearing a lead jumpsuit is a bit primitive. Instead, and along with this challenge, the concept of working respirators build into a full-coverage helmet will be a must. It is a balancing act in inventing armour that both protects and has a reasonable weight.</description>

		<description>Tiberium, being a mineral, would logically seem that it has an application of some kind. This feels more true by the fact our contacts through comms seemed to be holding back some kind of information about it by giving us only simple answers. Tiberium's self-sustaining growth is an alluring trait, something that might create a dangerous but useful yield for us. Putting our best minds forward to this curiosity, the colony can research and create a way to do so.</description>

		<description>After the work of reading through all of the technical jargon, there may be a solution. Thanks to the visuals and footnotes on some pages, it is in fact designs for a device that dampens the growth of Tiberium. It is proposed to work on Tiberium crystals by emitting a certain frequency that disturbs and essentially crumbles the growths by exploiting weaknesses in its crystalline structure. This is a great discovery, especially since it is within reach of us to build with the common materials we see on the Rim.</description>

		<description>The time working with Tiberium has taught us several things. But one major note is that it is radioactive. Many years ago, people found multiple uses for radioactive materials; mainly, they were used to generate electricity, generally through using the heat released by decay and controlled reactions. There's a chance that this could be done with Tiberium as well if we can do it correctly.</description>
